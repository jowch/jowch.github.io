# About

I'm a PhD student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) studying with [Gerard
Wong](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/gerard-wong/). My research applies modern
ML methods such as deep kernel learning and transformers to studying the
properties and interactions of peptides to find sequences with optimal
properties for use cases like drug development!

I'm also a [Julia](https://julialang.org) enthusiast! 

Previously, I studied [Computer Science](https://cse.wustl.edu) and
[Biology](https://biology.wustl.edu) at [Washington University in St.
Louis](https://wustl.edu/), ultimately receiving BS and MS degrees.
